# Cyfer-Programming-Language
Cyfer is a multi-paradigm programming language. Here are its features!
# Variables
The language is staticly typed. However you dont need to specify the types because Cyfer will infer that value at runtime.

Variables can be defined by typing its (type) (name) = (value), Heres an example:
```javascript
float some_variable = 349.123
```
You can use the 'any' type too, Cyfer will infer that value automatically.
```typescript
any fruit = "Banana"
```
You can also use 'var' for dynamic typing. Not recommended because this is a statically typed language.
```javascript
var dynamicTyping = "Use if you need."
dynamicTyping = 103
```
# Constants
Constant variables cant be changed in any way, Define one by prefixing 'const'. Heres an example:
```javascript
const float pi = 3.14
```
# Importing
Use the 'using' keyword to import a package/library
```c#
using System
```
You can also import from specific places.
```c#
using coolFunction from coolLibrary
```
# Loops
There are 4 types of loops, One is using the 'while' keyword, which will run code forever until the given condition is false.
Heres an example
```javascript
while true {
  println("Forever printing.")
}
```
