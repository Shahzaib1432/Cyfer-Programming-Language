# Cyfer-Programming-Language
Cyfer is a multi-paradigm programming language. Here are its features!
# Variables
The language is staticly typed. However you dont need to specify the types because Cyfer will infer that value at runtime
Variables can be defined by typing its (type) (name) (value), Heres an example:
```cyfer
float pi = 3.14
```
You can use the 'any' type too, Cyfer will infer that value automatically.
```cyfer
any fruit = "Banana"
```
You can also use 'var' for dynamic typing.
```cyfer
var dynamicTyping = "Use if you need."
dynamicTyping = 103
```
